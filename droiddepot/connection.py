DroidConnection is a BLE class representing a connection to a SWGE DroidDepot droid. 
It includes methods for connecting, disconnecting, sending commands, and running scripts on the droid.

It also includes instances of DroidAudioController, DroidMotorController, and DroidScriptEngine 
to manage the droid's audio, motor, and script functions.
